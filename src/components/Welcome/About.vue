        <h1>About me:</h1>
      </div>
      <p>My name is Noah Cardoza. I am currently studying at
        <a href="http://www.deanza.edu/" target="_blank">De Anza College</a>
        majoring in Computer Science. I also a studied at
        <a href="https://www.42.us.org/" target="_blank">Ã‰col 42</a> and
        at the moment my face happens to be displayed on their homepage. All publicity is
        good publicity!</p>
      <p>I spend my free time messing around with my Mac Book Pro and
        starting all kinds of wacky projects <em>E.G. this website...</em></p>
      <p>I enjoy coding, designing, and above all, learning. My interests
        range from photography and music to programming and new technology.
        I am also interested in web development, as evident by this stunning
        hunk of HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
